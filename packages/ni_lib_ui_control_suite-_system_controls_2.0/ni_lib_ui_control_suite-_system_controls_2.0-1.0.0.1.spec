[Description]
Description = "Description\0AThe LabVIEW system controls are great for developing user interfaces because they change appearance depending on which platform you run the VI. When you run the VI on a different platform, the system controls adapt their color and appearance to match the standard dialog box controls for that platform. This provides users a more familiar interface in LabVIEW.\0A\0AHowever, not all controls are available within the system palette, particularly the special LabVIEW controls and indicators used in many applications such as graphs, clusters, arrays, etc. The System Control Suite download provides additional LabVIEW controls customized to fit in well with the default Windows operating system controls. You can use these controls directly or you can use them to develop more customized controls as you enhance application user-interfaces.\0A\0ANew additions to the system control palette include graphs, charts, gauges, arrays, clusters as well as several icon-based buttons.\0A\0ASystem Requirements\0AApplication Software: LabVIEW Development System 2009 or later\0A\0AAdditional Information\0AThe Control Suite referenced here was created by the UI Interest group and is provided as is. All icons used come from the Open Icon Library Project. Links to detailed information and support for this suite and to the UI Interest group are included in the Resources tab."
